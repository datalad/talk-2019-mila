# DataLad

Talk on DataLad's data management capabilities, how it aids open science
efforts and helps achieve improved reproducibility in a FAIR way.  Heavily
based on the Bernstein Go Fair talk by Michael Hanke, then with mods for
OpenNeuro kick-off meeting, Stanford, 2018 by Yaroslav O. Halchenko, and
finally expanded for MILA.

URLs in the slides ATM are tuned for offline presentation.
